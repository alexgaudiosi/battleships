Battleships
===========

### Makers Academy Week 4 group task

This task was set by Evgeny Shadchnev. 
[@shadchnev](http://twitter.com/shadchnev) whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to complete two
classes to a given specification that could be used by a working Battleships
app written by Evgeny.

This was a group task and I worked with:
  - [Mikhail Dubov](https://github.com/duboff)
  - [Natascia Marchese](https://github.com/itsmurasaki)

Unfortunately we did not complete the task in the half day allocated, so this
code is unfinished and needs to be completed and refactored which I shall undertake
post Makers.
